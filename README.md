# SF6 Training Tools (Wael3rd Edition)

Welcome to the **SF6 Training Tools** suite — a comprehensive collection of Lua scripts, visual overlays, analytics dashboards, and a mobile remote control app designed to enhance your training experience in Street Fighter 6.

Whether you want to practice hit confirms, drill reactions, learn custom combos, visualize distances and hitboxes, or control everything from your phone — this toolkit has you covered.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following for Street Fighter 6:

1. **REFramework:** Already included in the release — just copy `dinput8.dll` into your SF6 folder (next to `StreetFighter6.exe`).
2. **REFramework D2D Plugin:** Required for all on-screen overlays. Also included in the release (`plugins/reframework-d2d.dll`) — no separate download needed.

## 📂 Installation Guide

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Wael3rd/SF6_Tools/releases) and extract the contents into your SF6 game folder. The `reframework/` folder structure merges automatically.

## ⌨️ Shortcuts & Controls

You do not need to keep the menu open. The tools are controlled entirely via your controller using a **Function Button** system.

**The "Function" Key (Func):**

- You must **HOLD** this button to access the shortcuts below.

| Action | Shortcut (Hold Func + Press...) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start / Pause** | `RIGHT` (D-Pad) | Starts the drill or pauses the current session. |
| **Stop / Reset** | `LEFT` (D-Pad) | Stops the drill, resets the score, and **Exports stats** to a file. |
| **Increase Timer** | `UP` (D-Pad) | Adds time to the current drill timer. |
| **Decrease Timer** | `DOWN` (D-Pad) | Reduces time from the current drill timer. |

Keyboard shortcuts are also available per mode — see the individual guides in `guides/`.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Menu not showing?** Press `Insert` to open REFramework.
- **Text looks wrong/blocks?** Ensure the font files are correctly placed in `reframework/fonts/`.
- **Shortcuts not working?** Make sure you are **holding** the Function button (`Select` or `R3`) while pressing the D-Pad.
- **Script crash?** Ensure you have the latest REFramework Nightly build.
- **Distance Viewer not showing?** Make sure `reframework-d2d.dll` is in `reframework/plugins/`.
