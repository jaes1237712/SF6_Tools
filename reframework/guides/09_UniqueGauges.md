# SF6 Unique Gauge System — Research & Integration Notes

> How Street Fighter 6 stores and applies per-character "unique" resources (Jamie drinks,
> Blanka-chan bombs, Juri Fuha stocks, etc.), and how Custom Combo Trials records and
> replays them.

## TL;DR

| Need | Answer |
|---|---|
| Read the CURRENT level (live) | `cPlayer.mStyleNo` (0 = none, N = current stock/level) |
| Previous level | `cPlayer.style_old` (65535 = never changed this round) |
| Apply a level programmatically | Set `TrainingManager._tData.ParameterSetting.UniqueData.stock_0_XXX = N`, then `TrainingManager:call("set_IsReqRefresh", true)` |
| Damage modifier (Jamie) | `style_hosei_atk = 90 + 5 × drinks` |

## The fields (nBattle.cPlayer)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mStyleNo` | **Current** style level — the source of truth. Jamie: 0–4 drinks. |
| `mReqStyle` | Requested style level (consumed by the engine). |
| `style_old` | **Previous** level, not the current one. `65535` means "never had a style this round". |
| `style_hosei_atk` | Attack modifier %. Jamie: `90 + 5 × drinks` (90 sober → 110 at 4 drinks). |
| `comb_id` | Active command-table id. Changes with style level (Jamie: 2 → 4 → 5) but only syncs on the next act/round init — do not write it manually. |
| `style_timer` | Timer for install-type styles (Feng Shui Engine, Devil's Song…). |

## The methods (nBattle.cPlayer)

| Method | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `pl_style_change(delta, 1)` | **Relative** change. The natural drink action calls `pl_style_change(1, 1)`. |
| `pl_style_change(level, 0)` | **Absolute** re-assert. The game itself calls this periodically to refresh modifiers. Called alone from script it only updates modifiers/visuals — not the counter UI or command table. |
| `pl_style_set(level)` | Writes the level field only. No side effects. |
| `pl_style_update()` | Frame update tick, no arguments. Not a refresh trigger. |

**Important:** none of these, called in isolation, reproduce the complete natural drink
(counter UI + command table + visuals + modifiers). The complete state only assembles
when the engine itself applies the style — which happens on a **training refresh**.

## The reliable apply path (what Combo Trials uses)

```lua
-- 1. Set the training menu unique stock for the character
local tm = sdk.get_managed_singleton("app.training.TrainingManager")
local ud = tm:get_field("_tData"):get_field("ParameterSetting"):get_field("UniqueData")
ud:set_field("stock_0_021", 2)          -- Jamie = char id 21, field = stock_0_%03d
-- 2. Trigger the native refresh
tm:call("set_IsReqRefresh", true)
```

The refresh applies everything natively: `mStyleNo`, `comb_id`, drink counter UI, hair,
unlocked moves. It also re-applies every other menu setting (HP/gauges/positions), which
Combo Trials already compensates for with its own gauge/vital injection.

`UniqueData` field names per character (`stock_0_%03d` / `timer_0_%03d` with the ESF
character id): Ryu `timer_0_001`, Kimberly `stock_0_003`, Manon `stock_0_005`, Lily
`stock_0_012`, Blanka `timer/stock_0_015`, Juri `timer/stock_0_016`, Guile `timer_0_018`,
E.Honda `stock_0_020`, Jamie `timer/stock_0_021`, Mai `stock_0_028`, C.Viper
`timer_0_030`, Ingrid `stock_0_032`.

## Combo Trials integration (TrainingComboTrials_v1.0.lua)

- **Recording** — `snapshot_gauges()` captures `attacker:get_field("mStyleNo")` at combo
  start. If > 0 it is saved into `combo_stats.style_stock` (+ `style_char_id`) in the
  combo JSON.
- **Trial start** — `apply_trial_vital()` backs up the current `UniqueData` stock into
  `trial_state._saved_unique_atk`, writes `style_stock` into the menu field, and the
  trial's existing refresh applies it natively.
- **Trial end** — `restore_trial_vital()` writes the backed-up value back.

Combos recorded without an active style carry no `style_stock` key and behave exactly
as before (zero overhead, fully backward compatible).

## Current status & testing

| Character | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Jamie** (Drink Level) | stock | ✅ **Tested — works 100%** (record, replay, restore) |
| Ryu (Denjin Charge) | timer | ❌ **Not working** — timer-type application is not implemented |
| Kimberly, Manon, Lily, E.Honda, Mai, Ingrid, Blanka/Juri stocks | stock | ⚠ Untested — same code path as Jamie, should work but needs in-game verification |
| Guile, C.Viper, Blanka/Juri/Jamie timers | timer | ❌ Not implemented |

### How to contribute

1. **Verify a stock character**: gain the resource in-game (not via the menu), record a
   combo, then open the JSON in `data/TrainingComboTrials_data/CustomCombos/<char>/` and
   check `combo_stats.style_stock` matches what you had. Launch the trial and verify the
   counter/moves/visuals apply; exit the trial and verify the training menu value is
   restored. If a character's `mStyleNo` does not map 1:1 to its menu stock value, a
   per-character mapping table is needed in `apply_trial_vital()`.
2. **The three integration points** in `TrainingComboTrials_v1.0.lua`:
   - `snapshot_gauges()` — reads `mStyleNo` at recording start
   - `apply_trial_vital()` — backs up + writes `UniqueData.stock_0_XXX` before the refresh
   - `restore_trial_vital()` — restores the backed-up menu value
3. **Adding timer-type support** (Denjin Charge, Feng Shui Engine, Solid Puncher…):
   record needs `style_timer` (and whether the install is active), apply needs
   `timer_0_XXX` (0 = Standard, 1 = Activated/Maximum, 2 = Infinite) plus, for install
   characters, an initial `style_timer` value written on round start. The refresh path
   is the same as for stocks.

## Verified caveats

- The in-game drink **counter UI** does not follow programmatic `pl_style_change` calls —
  only the menu + refresh path updates it.
- `comb_id` (unlocked moves) also requires the refresh; it does not sync from
  `mStyleNo` writes alone in a static training state.
- A training refresh **resets programmatic style state** to whatever the menu says —
  which is exactly why writing the menu first is the only stable approach.
- Timer-type installs (Denjin Charge, Feng Shui Engine…) use `timer_0_XXX` + 
  `style_timer` and are **not** recorded yet — only stock-type styles are.
- Scripts placed in **subfolders of `autorun/`** are not re-run by Reset Scripts:
  test probes must live at the top level of `autorun/`.
